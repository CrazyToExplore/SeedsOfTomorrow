**Chapter 8: New Horizons, Timeless Values**

As the 'Seeds of Tomorrow' university matured, new avenues opened up. Departments dedicated to technology, sustainability, and social entrepreneurship were established, attracting global attention. The institution was no longer just a place of learning; it had evolved into a crucible of innovation.

Ravi, a tech prodigy from Bengaluru, India, embarked on a mission to use technology for social change. Taking inspiration from the Indian business tycoon Ratan Tata, he often quoted, "I don’t believe in taking right decisions. I take decisions and then make them right." Ravi introduced a course that blended technology with ethical considerations, ensuring that innovations had a heart and soul.

Elsewhere, Deepa, a student from the foothills of the Himalayas, launched an initiative focusing on sustainable farming practices. Citing the words of the Indian environmental activist Vandana Shiva, she expressed, "You are not Atlas carrying the world on your shoulder. It is good to remember that the planet is carrying you." Her workshops emphasized coexistence, highlighting the balance between human progress and nature's well-being.

Amidst these fresh endeavors, Mia felt the need to preserve the core values of 'Seeds of Tomorrow.' She introduced a mandatory course called "Roots of Tomorrow" for every freshman. This course explored the foundational principles of the institution, ensuring that as the university expanded, its core ethos remained intact.

One day, the university had a surprise visitor, Priyanka, a globally acclaimed Indian actress and philanthropist. During her interaction with the students, she shared her journey, emphasizing the blend of modernity with tradition. Quoting the famous Indian author, Amish Tripathi, she said, "Truth doesn’t have to be liked. It only has to be spoken." Her words resonated with many, underlining the importance of authenticity in an ever-changing world.

The chapter culminated with a grand event - 'Horizons,' a showcase of the university's latest projects, innovations, and achievements. As visitors from around the world walked through the exhibits, they witnessed the seamless blend of cutting-edge technology with age-old wisdom.

Ethan, watching from the sidelines, felt immense pride. The seeds he had sown had not only grown into a majestic tree but had also birthed an entire forest. Reflecting upon the journey, he whispered words inspired by the ancient Indian scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, "We are kept from our goal not by obstacles, but by a clear path to a lesser goal." The 'Seeds of Tomorrow' had indeed chosen the path less traveled, journeying towards a greater, shared dream.
