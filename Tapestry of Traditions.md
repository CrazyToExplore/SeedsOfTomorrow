**Chapter 7: The Tapestry of Traditions**

The 'Seeds of Tomorrow' university became a melting pot of cultures. As more students from diverse backgrounds enrolled, there was a growing desire to understand and celebrate the rich tapestry of traditions they represented.

Rohan, a student from the heartlands of India, felt a deep connection to his roots. Inspired by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, India's beloved former President and scientist, he often recited, "Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action." Rohan dreamt of celebrating India's vast heritage at the university.

With Mia's encouragement, he started a cultural week dedicated to India, named 'Bharat Utsav.' Activities ranged from traditional dance workshops to philosophical discussions based on ancient Indian scriptures.

During one of the sessions, Rohan quoted Swami Vivekananda, a revered Indian monk, saying, "Arise, awake, and stop not until the goal is reached." He used this to inspire his peers to explore and embrace their own cultures, creating a ripple effect of cultural appreciation.

'Bharat Utsav' was a resounding success, leading to the inception of similar cultural weeks for other countries. This blend of traditions created a harmonious environment where students felt seen and heard, embodying Rabindranath Tagore's vision: "Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high; Where knowledge is free."

Amidst this cultural revival, the university welcomed a special guest, Amara, an acclaimed Indian author. During her keynote speech, she quoted the renowned Indian film director Satyajit Ray, emphasizing, "The director is the only person who knows what the film is about." She related this to life, urging students to be the directors of their own stories, embracing every twist and turn.

On the last day of 'Bharat Utsav,' a grand finale was organized. Traditional lanterns illuminated the sky, and as they floated upwards, Ethan, deeply moved by the display, quoted the legendary Indian leader, Mahatma Gandhi: "Be the change that you wish to see in the world."

The 'Seeds of Tomorrow' had indeed sown seeds that transcended borders, cultures, and traditions. It wasn't just an institution but a living embodiment of unity in diversity, reflecting the timeless wisdom from various corners of the world.
